            <p class="passing"> ‚ë° <br> reflection: <br> HTML & <br> wordpress <br> website <br> development <br>  </p>
            <div class="box-11"> <p class="adjust"> Firstly, I will start off by saying that before this project, I had zero experience in coding. Every term, concept, and idea I learnt was brand new to me. Because of that, I found the Wordpress website much easier to operate over the HTML and CSS website. Specifically, Wordpress is a very easy and straightforward program. They provide various templates and designs and all you have to do is insert your content. It requires minimal coding making it very convenient for any user. The only challenge I faced in wordpress was trying to adjust the layout of my media. For example, if I were to insert a photo, the photo can only be positioned based off the template design. Other than that, making my wordpress website was a straightforward process. <br> <br>
                On the other hand, the HTML/CSS website was a whole different story. HTML and CSS only provides you with an ID and a white empty page. As a new learner, I was very concerned because I had no idea how to code or where to start; I was just staring at a white empty screen. I went on google and researched how to code every single element: The title, text, navigation bar, background, and style. Slowly slowly, I got the hang of it and began to understand the concept of code. The hardest concept to learn was the CSS flexbox layout. I still don‚Äôt know if I can explain it, but if I were to try: it is a box which organizes the content on your page by dividing your work. The reason I found it challenging to learn was because firstly, I was absent on the day it was taught. So, I did not know this feature existed. So, when it came to formatting my website, I found it very difficult and it made me very frustrated when it organized my content in the wrong way. After asking my brother-in-law, he explained it in a very clear way and it all made sense. <br><br> Significantly, HTML is a program that gives you full control over the design of your website. Unlike wordpress, I was able to move my media around, make my own navigation bar, and have complete control over everything. It is a program that for a new learner requires patience and persistence because at times, you would think you are doing everything right, but it is wrong; so, you have to go back and redo everything. If I could give an analogy for developing these two websites: wordpress is like a coloring book and HTML/CSS is just a blank canvas.

            <p class=adjust> <b> Introduction</b> <br><br> Sort the Court is a whimsical simulation game, in which you rule over a small promising kingdom as King or Queen making decisions to approve or reject the requests of your citizens. Each choice has its own consequence, which earns or loses you one of these three resources: population, happiness, and gold. It is up to you to carefully manage these resources and make decisions that will help your kingdom thrive.Throughout your reign, you will interact with a variety of interesting characters, both from and out of your kingdom. Each character has their own unique style and personality, which influence their whims and requests. Using Y or N, you are responsible to approve or reject their requests. The goal of the game is to reach ‚ÄòThe Council of Crowns‚Äô, which is the highest honor you can receive and a symbol of game completion.

            <p class=adjust> <b> Characters</b> <br><br> The game takes place in one setting, The Throne Room of your Castle. The foreground consists of a golden throne surrounded by the amount of gold coins you possess. The background consists of a window showcasing your kingdom. At the start, your view is a bunch of wooden huts and farms, but as your kingdom thrives, it becomes a bustling metropolis filled with palaces and towers. Generally, this game has an arcade-like and retro feel to it. This aesthetic can be attributed to its charming pixel art style, minimal sound effects, and gentle ambient music in the background. In addition, Sort the Court uses a simple color palette‚Äì one that represents the colors of nature such as green, blue, brown, and orange. But, they also use regal colors such as gold and red to signify the King‚Äôs importance. Overall, the game‚Äôs simple colors, sound effects, music, controls, and pixel art style all contribute to its medieval retro setting.

            <p class=adjust> <b> Discussion </b> <br><br> In retrospect, this game was fun and engaging. However, as a player who loves explore-games, I wish this game featured multiple settings rather than just the Throne room. The creator could have improved on that and allow the player to explore the city they built instead of just hearing about it from the dialogue of other characters. In addition, another limitation was the customization features. The creator could have added choices for players to customize their character‚Äôs appearance, clothes, or throne room and make the game feel more unique and personalized. The last thing I want to comment on are the sad stance and facial expression of the King and Queen. Throughout the whole game, the king or queen remained in the same position‚Äì slouched, hands in their pockets, and hopeless facial expressions. The creator could have emotionalized the King or Queen by adding happy, sad, or distressed facial expressions. Nevertheless, it was still a fun experience and I enjoyed the gameplay.
