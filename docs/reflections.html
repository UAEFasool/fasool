        <p class="portfoliodescription"> an overview of the pros and cons of HTML and Wordpress.  
        </p>
        <p class="adjust"> Firstly, I will start off by saying that before this project, I had zero experience in coding. Every term, concept, and idea that I learnt during this project was fresh and brand new. Because of that, I found the Wordpress website much easier to create than the HTML and CSS website. Specifically, Wordpress is a very easy and straightforward program. They gave you prepared templates to choose from and all you have to do is insert your content. It requires zero coding making it very convenient for the user. The only challenge I faced in wordpress was trying to adjust the layout of my media. For example, if I were to insert a photo, the photo would be positioned according to the template‚Äôs design. Other than that, it was a straightforward process and it took me about five hours to finalize the website. <br> <br> On the other hand, the HTML and CSS website was a whole different story. All HTML and CSS gives you is an ID and a white empty page. As a new learner, I was very concerned at the start because I have no idea how to code. I did not know how to write a title or any text or insert a picture. So, I had to go on google to research how to make a title and do all of these features. I did that many times until I eventually got used to it and started getting the hang of it. The hardest concept to learn was the CSS flexbox layout. I don‚Äôt know if I can explain it, but if I were to try: it is a box which organizes the content on your page. The reason I found it challenging to learn was because firstly, I was absent on the day it was taught. So, I did not know this feature existed. So, when it came to formatting my website, I found it very difficult and it made me very frustrated when it organized my content in the wrong way. But after asking my brother-in-law, he explained it in a very clear way and it all made sense. <br> <br> Significantly, HTML is a program that gives you full control over the design of your website. Unlike wordpress, I was able to move my media around, pick a specific navigation bar, and have complete control over everything. It is a program that for a new learner requires patience and persistence because at times, you would think you are doing everything right, but it is wrong; so, you have to go back and redo everything. The one skill I want to improve in HTML is making some of my content more animated so it can be more visually appealing for the user.
